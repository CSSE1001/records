                <p>
                    This assignment follows a programming pattern called MVC
                    (the Model, View, Controller) pattern. You have been provided
                    with the view and controller classes but you will be required
                    to implement several modelling classes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The modelling classes are from the popular card game, Uno.
                    Each class you're required to implement has a specification
                    that is outlined in this document. A specification is a
                    description of each method in a class as well as their parameters
                    and return values.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once you have implemented the modelling classes, you will have
                    completed a digital version of Uno that follows the MVC pattern.

            <h2 class="header">Gameplay</h2><a name="sec_gameplay"></a>

            <p>
                Uno is a card based game consisting primarily of cards with both
                a colour and a number. Each player starts with a deck of seven
                cards. The player whose cards are visible is the starting player.
                Once the player makes a move by selecting their card to play,
                their cards will be hidden and it will move to the next players
                turn.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are two piles in the middle of the board. The left pile
                is the pickup pile, a player should click this pile if they have
                no cards to play, it will add a card to their deck. The right pile
                is the putdown pile, a player has to pick a card from their deck
                which matches the card on top of the putdown pile.
            </p>

            <p>
                The aim of the game is to have no cards left in your deck. Each
                turn a player can either select a card from their pile which matches
                the card on top of the putdown pile, or, they can pickup a new
                card from the pickup pile if they have no matching cards.

            A card represents a card in the uno game which has colour and number
            attributes.
            <section>
                <h3 class="header">Card</h3><a name="sec_card"></a>

                <p>The basic type of colour and number.</p>

                <p>Instances of Card should be initialized with Card(number, colour).
                The following methods must be implemented:</p>

                <p><strong>get_number(self):</strong> Returns the card number</p>
                <p><strong>get_colour(self):</strong> Returns the card colour</p>
                <p><strong>set_number(self, number: int):</strong> Set the number value of the card</p>
                <p><strong>set_colour(self, colour: <span data-version="1.0.1">a2_support.</span>CardColour):</strong> Set the colour of the card</p>
                <p><strong>get_pickup_amount(self):</strong> Returns the amount of cards the next player should pickup</p>
                <p><strong>matches(self, card: Card):</strong> Determines if the next card to be placed on the pile matches this card.</p>
                <p>"Matches" is defined as being able to be placed on top of this card legally.</p>
                <p>A "match" for the base Card is a card of the same colour or number.</p>
                <p><strong>play(self, player: Player, game: a2_support.UnoGame):</strong> Perform a special card action. The base Card class has no special action.</p>
                <p><strong>Hint: Look at the a2_support.UnoGame methods</strong></p>
                <p><strong>__str__(self):</strong> Returns the string representation of this card.</p>
                <p><strong>__repr__(self):</strong> Same as __str__(self)</p>
            </section><br/>

            <p>For the following examples, assume that the below code has been executed:</p>

>>> game = a2_support.UnoGame(deck, players)
            </pre>

            <p><strong>Each of the following classes should be a subclass of Card and should only alter methods required to
                implement the functionality of the card as described.</strong></p>

            <h2 class="header">Assignment Submission</h2><a name="sec_submission"></a>

            <p>
                Your assignment must be submitted via the assignment three submission link on Blackboard.

                You must submit a file, <code>a2.py</code>, containing your submission for this assignment.
                You do not need to submit any other files.
            </p>

            <p>
                Late submission of the assignment will <strong>not</strong> be accepted. Do not wait until the last
                minute to submit your assignment, as the time to upload it may make it late. Multiple submissions are
                allowed, so ensure that you have submitted an almost complete version of the assignment well before the
                submission deadline of 6pm. Your latest, on time, submission will be marked. Ensure that you submit the
                correct version of your assignment. In the event of exceptional circumstances, you may submit a request
                for an extension. See the <a
                    href="http://www.courses.uq.edu.au/student_section_loader.php?section=5&profileId=92705">course
                profile</a> for details of how to apply for an extension.
            </p>

            <p>
                Requests for extensions must be made <strong>no later</strong> than 48 hours prior to the submission
                deadline. The expectation is that with less than 48 hours before an assignment is due it should be
                substantially completed and submittable. Applications for extension, and any supporting documentation
                (e.g. medical certificate), must be submitted via <a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/">my.UQ</a>. You must
                retain the original documentation for a <em>minimum period</em> of six months to provide as verification
                should you be requested to do so.
