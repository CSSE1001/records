                <h2 class="header">Introduction</h2><a name="sec_intro"></a>

                <p>The goal of this assignment is to extend the existing support code of a mario style 2D-platformer
                    written in Python using tkinter.
                </p>

                <p>To be successful in completing this assignment you will have to use the concepts and skills
                    that you have learnt. Specifically, you will need to have a good understanding of GUI programming,
                    inter-class interactions, extending classes and file IO.
                </p>

                <p>This document outlines the tasks that you will need to implement for this assignment.
                </p>

                <h3 class="header">Getting Started</h3><a name="sec_getting_started"></a>

                <p>The archive file <code>a3_files.zip</code> contains all the necessary files to start this assignment.
                    A significant amount of support code has been provided to allow for the basic working game 
                    functionality to be implemented relatively easily. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The main assignment file is <code>app.py</code>, which contains an incomplete implementation of
                    <code>MarioApp</code>, the top-level GUI application class. You should add code to 
                    <code>app.py</code> and modify <code>MarioApp</code> to implement the necessary functionality.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All features and code you write should be placed inside <code>app.py</code><span data-version="1.1.0">,
                    <code>level.py</code> or <code>player.py</code>.</span>
                    <strong>You are not permitted to modify any files inside the
                        <span data-version="1.1.0">game</span> directory.</strong>
                    <strong>Your assignment must be able to be launched by running <code>app.py</code></strong>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Because this assignment deals with multiple files, while not required, you may wish to investigate a
                    more sophisticated IDE. One option is <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>,
                    which is <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/student/">free for students</a>.

                    <h4>Pymunk Library</h4><a name="pymunk"></a>

                    <p>Physics is implemented in the game using the <a href="http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/">Pymunk
                        library</a>. It may be useful in completing the assignment to have an understanding of
                        some of the components of the Pymunk library as you may need to refer to these libraries.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>You will need to install this library in order to implement your tasks for this assignment.</strong>
                        Pymunk can be installed by running the included <code>setup.py</code>.

            <h2 class="header">Overview</h2><a name="sec_tasks"></a>

            <p>The assignment is broken down into three main tasks:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The first task involves modifying the app.py file to implement basic launching of the game
                    and some additional functionality</li>
                <li>The second task involves extending the game mechanics to add more functionality to the game</li>
                <li>The third task is for you to independently design and implement a sufficiently complex feature of your choosing</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                <strong>For postgraduates:</strong> There is an additional task for you to complete. You will need
                to appropriately implement animations using sprite sheets in the <code>spritesheets</code> folder.
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2 class="header">Task 1 - Basic GUI</h2><a name="sec_task1"></a>

            <section>
                <h3 class="header">1.1 - Working Game</h3>

                <p>For this task, you will need to write code in <code>app.py</code>,
                    which will start the game when the file is run. This will
                    require you to write the <code>main</code> function to launch
                    the <code>MarioApp</code> GUI.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You should modify <code>MarioApp</code> so that the window title is 
                    something appropriate (e.g. "Mario")
                </p>

                <p>Once the game runs, you will need to implement keyboard
                    bindings. You should find an appropriate location in the class
                    to make <code>bind</code> calls for each of the keyboard
                    presses to the appropriate method. The binds should behave as follows:
                </p>

                <table class="mark-breakdown">
                    <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Key</th>
                        <th>Action</th>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr class="task">
                        <td>W, UP, SPACE</td>
                        <td>Makes the player jump (Hint: see <code>MarioApp._jump</code>).
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr class="task">
                        <td>A, LEFT</td>
                        <td>Moves the player to the left (Hint: see <code>MarioApp._move</code>).
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr class="task">
                        <td>S, DOWN</td>
                        <td>Makes the player duck (Hint: see <code>MarioApp._duck</code>).
                        </td>

                    <tr class="task">
                        <td>D, RIGHT</td>
                        <td>Moves the player to the right (Hint: see <code>MarioApp._move</code>).
                    </tr>

                <h3 class="header">1.2 - File Menu and Dialogs</h3>

                <p>Implement a menu for the game which has a top level "File" menu.
                    Within the "File" menu, you will need the following buttons:
                </p>

                <table class="mark-breakdown">
                    <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Button</th>
                        <th>Purpose</th>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr class="task">
                        <td>Load Level</td>
                        <td>Prompts the user with a popup text input dialog.
                            When the player inputs a level filename, load that
                            level replacing the currently loaded level.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr class="task">
                        <td>Reset Level</td>
                        <td>Reset all player progress (e.g. health, score, etc) in the current level. 
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr class="task">
                        <td>Exit</td>
                        <td>Exits the game.</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>When a player runs out of health, you should show a dialogue asking
                    whether they want to restart the current level or exit the game.</p>

                <p>Note: On Mac OS X, the file menu should appear in the global menu bar (top of the screen).</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3 class="header">1.3 - Status Display</h3>

                <p>Implement a custom tkinter widget (i.e. a class which inherits from <code>tk.Frame</code>)
                    which displays the score and health of the player at the bottom of the window.
                </p>

                <p>The player's score should be shown as a single number. The health of the
                    player should be displayed as a 'health bar' (similar to the image below).
                    The health bar should be coloured as follows:
                    <ul class="browser-default">
                        <li>When the player has greater than or equal to 50% of their maximum health,
                            it should be coloured green.</li>
                        <li>When the player has between 25% and 50% of their maximum health,
                            it should be coloured orange.</li>
                        <li>When the player has less than or equal to 25% of their maximum health,
                            it should be coloured red.</li>
                    </ul></p>

                <p>This widget needs to be updated when the score and health of the player updates during gameplay.
                </p>

                <div class="card">
                    <a name="fig_example"></a>

            <section>
                <h3 class="header">1.4 - Bounce Block <img src="public/images/bounce.png"/></h3>

                <p>Implement a type of block which will propel the player into
                    the air when they walk over or jump on top of the block.
                </p>

                <p>The velocity with which you propel the player should be sensible
                    but noticeable.
                </p>

                <p>Hint: You should implement a bounce block by making a new
                    class which extends <code>Block</code>.
                </p>
                
                <p>You may (and should) utilise the <code>bounce_block</code> image files found in <code>a3_files.zip</code></p>

                <p>The bounce block is represented by the character, <code>b</code> in level files.</p>

            <section>
                <h3 class="header">1.5 - Mushroom Mob <img src="public/images/mushroom.png"/></h3>

                <p>Implement a new type of mob which has the following properties:</p>
                <ul class="browser-default">
                    <li> The mob should move at a reasonably slow rate</li>
                    <li> When the mob collides with a block, player, or other mob it should
                        reverse its direction (HINT: <code>Mob.set_tempo</code>)</li>
                    <li> When the mob collides with the side of a player, the
                        player should lose 1 health point and be slightly repelled
                        away from the mob</li>
                    <li> When a player lands on top of the mob, the player should
                        bounce off the top of the mob and the mob should be destroyed</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You may find it useful to look at the existing mob classes and collision
                    handling methods before commencing this task.</p>
                
                <p>You may (and should) utilise the <code>mushroom</code> image files found in <code>a3_files.zip</code></p>

                <p>The mushroom mob is represented by the character, <code>@</code> in level files.</p>

                <p>Implement a type of item that makes the player invincible for 10 seconds
                    (that is, they should not be able to take any damage during this time).
                    Any mobs that the player collides with during this time should be immediately

                </p>

                <p>During the time the player is invincible, the player's health bar should
                    be coloured yellow.</p>

                <h3 class="header">2.3 - Loading Configuration</h3>

                <p>Implement the ability to load a configuration file for a game of mario.
                    When the game is launched the user should be prompted to enter the file path
                    for a configuration file.</p>
                <p>The configuration file will be in a similar format to the example given below.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-content">
                <pre>
==World==
gravity : 400
start : level1.txt

==Player==
character : luigi
x : 30
y : 30
mass : 100
health : 4
max_velocity : 100

==level1.txt==
tunnel : bonus.txt
goal : level2.txt

==bonus.txt==
goal : level1.txt

==level2.txt==
tunnel : small_room.txt
goal : level3.txt
<span data-version="1.1.0">
==small_room.txt==
goal : level2.txt
</span>
==level3.txt==
goal : END
                </pre>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>At the minimum, a configuration file will include a <code>==World==</code>
                    tag, a <code>==Player==</code> tag and a tag for the level specified as
                    start in <code>==World==</code>
                </p>

                <p>A <code>==World==</code> tag should have a <code>gravity</code> property which will set
                    the gravity of a world when it is constructed. It should also contain
                    a <code>start</code> property which will be the filepath of the first level to load.
                </p>

                <p>A <code>==Player==</code> tag should have the following properties:</p>
                <ul class="browser-default">
                    <li>character: This can be either mario or luigi and will change the image displayed in game.</li>
                    <li>x: This is the starting x co-ordinate of the player.</li>
                    <li>y: This is the starting y co-ordinate of the player.</li>
                    <li>mass: This is the weight of the player set when adding the player to the world.</li>
                    <li>health: This is the maximum amount of health a player will have.</li>
                    <li>max_velocity: This is the maximum x velocity that a player can reach when moving.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each of the levels should have it's own tag, e.g. <code>==level==</code> where
                    level is the file path of that level.<br/>
                    A level tag should have a <code>goal</code> property which is the filename
                    of the level to load when the player reaches a flag goal block.
                    If the next level is END then it should prompt the user that the game is
                    over and close the game window.
                    <br/>
                    A level tag may also have a <code>tunnel</code> property which is the filename
                    of the level to load when the player enters a tunnel block.
                </p>

                <p>If the configuration file is invalid, or missing and cannot be parsed, you should alert
                    the user via a <code>tkinter</code> error message box and then exit the game.</p>

                <h3 class="header">2.4 - Switches <img src="public/images/switch.png"/></h3>
                <p>Implement a new type of block that acts like a switch. When a player lands on-top of
                a switch, all bricks within a close radius of the switch should disappear. A player
                should not be able to trigger a switch by walking into the side of it (the player should
                stop moving as if it were any other block).</p> 

                <p>When a switch is pressed, it should remain in a 'pressed' state
                    (<img src="public/images/switch_pressed.png"/>) for 10 seconds. During this time,
                    the player should not be able to collide with this block (HINT: returning <code>False</code>
                    from a collision handler will turn off collisions). After this time, the switch should revert to its original state and all invisible bricks should become visible again.</p>

                <p>It is up to you to pick a sensible radius for the switch. It needs to be noticable
                    when playing with the supplied level files.</p>

                <p>You may (and should) utilise the <code>switch</code> and <code>switch_pressed</code> image files found in <code>a3_files.zip</code></p>

                <p>The switch is represented by the character, <code>S</code> in level files.</p>

                <h3 class="header">2.5 - High Scores</h3>

                <p>In this task you should implement a way to store the high scores for each level in a file.
                </p>

                <p>The highscore information should be stored in (a) txt file(s) in a reasonable format.
                    The exact format of the file(s) and way the data is stored is up to you but marks
                    may be deducted for inappropriate save format.
                </p>

                <p>When a player reaches a goal (and therefore finishes a level),
                    prompt the user via a dialog for their name and store the score they had 
                    at the end of the level to the relevant file for the level (creating it if it doesn't exist). 
                    Adding a new entry to the file shouldn't remove any existing entries already in it.
                </p>

                <p>Add a button to the file menu called "High Scores". When clicked this will
                    open a new custom <code>tk.TopLevel</code> window displaying
                    the names and scores of the top ten highest scorers for the current level,
                    sorted in descending order by score. Note that the file might have more or less than
                    ten entries, but you shouldn't display more than the top ten entries in the window.
                    If the file doesn't exist, the dialog shouldn't display any entries.

            <h2 class="header">Task 3 - Over to You</h2><a name="sec_task1"></a>

            <p>For this task you are expected to demonstrate your ability to intelligently
                extend the features of the base game. The features that you choose to
                implement are left up to you. For full marks in this task your features
                will need to be of sufficient complexity. For example, sound effects
                are generally <em>not</em> deemed to be of 'sufficient complexity'.
            </p>

            <p>It is highly encouraged that you only attempt this task if you feel
                confident in your programming ability. You will need to discuss
                your plans for this task with a tutor in a practical or via a private
                question on Piazza. The tutor will be able to advise you
                as to whether your intended feature is of sufficient complexity to gain marks.
            </p>

            <p>If you are attempting to implement this task then you must submit a feature
                PDF which outlines exactly what features you have implemented and how
                to use them when running your assignment. The PDF should include
                screenshots of the features and a brief description of how the
                features were implemented.
            </p>

            <h2 class="header">Postgraduate Task</h2><a name="sec_task1"></a>

            <p>The task for postgraduate students is to implement a class <code>SpriteSheetLoader</code>
                which is able to load images from a sprite sheet. A sprite sheet is an image which
                consists of multiple smaller images, see the spritesheets folder for reference.
                The <code>SpriteSheetLoader</code> should be able to load one of the smaller images
                from a sprite sheet based on the smaller images location and position within the sheet.
            </p>

            <p>Hint: To implement this, you will want to investigate using the
                <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pillow library</a></p>

            <p>Hint: To implement this, you may also want to investigate making a
                new <code>ViewRenderer</code> subclass to handle sprite sheets.
                Ensure that loaded images are stored in the <code>self._images</code>
                dictionary within the new <code>ViewRenderer</code> subclass.
            </p>

            <p>In addition to loading images from a spritesheet, you will need
                to implement animations for the following entities.
            </p>

            <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Player: When the player is walking, jumping or falling animate the
                    player with the appropriate sprites from the <code>characters</code> sprite sheet.</li>
                <li>Mushroom Mob: When the mushroom mob is walking, animate the walk using the
                    appropriate sprites from the <code>enemies</code> sprite sheet.
                </li>
                <li>Mushroom Mob: When the mushroom mob is jumped on, animate the squishing using the
                    appropriate sprites from the <code>enemies</code> sprite sheet.
                </li>
                <li>Coins: Animate the coin to be spinning using the
                    appropriate sprites from the <code>items</code> sprite sheet.
                </li>
                <li>Bounce Block: When the bounce block is used, animate the
                    extension of the bounce block using the sprites in the <code>items</code> sprite sheet.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section><h2 class="header">Marking</h2><a name="sec_marking"></a>

            <p>

            <p>
                Style = Style Marks * Task 1 Percentage
            </p>

            <p>Your total mark will be made up of functionality marks and style marks.
                Functionality marks are worth 15 of the 20 available marks and style marks
                are worth the other 5 marks.

                            reading, its meaning has been clarified using appropriate inline comments.

                            so as to distract from the intention. Blocks of related code have been grouped
                            together through vertical whitespace to produce logical groups of code.

            <h2 class="header">Assignment Submission</h2><a
                name="sec_submission"></a>
            <p>Your assignment must be submitted via the assignment three submission link on Blackboard.
                You must submit a python file, <code>app.py</code>, containing your implementation of the assignment.
                If you attempted task 3 then you must also submit a PDF file, <code>features.pdf</code>, containing
                a description of your features.
                Both files should be uploaded individually to blackboard.
                If you modify <code>player.py</code> or <code>level.py</code> then you must also upload those files.
                If you require additional assets for task 3, upload all your assets, python files and features pdf
                in a single zip archive named <code>a3.zip</code>.
                Once submitted download the support code and your app.py submission from blackboard
                and place the app.py in the extracted support code file to ensure everything works as expected.
            </p>

            <p>
                Late submission of the assignment will <strong>not</strong> be accepted. Do not wait until the last
                minute to submit your assignment, as the time to upload it may make it late. Multiple submissions are
                allowed, so ensure that you have submitted an almost complete version of the assignment <em>well</em>
                before the submission deadline. Your latest on-time, submission will be marked. Ensure that you submit
                the correct version of your assignment. An incorrect version that does not work <strong>will</strong>
                be marked as your final submission.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the event of exceptional circumstances, you may submit a request for an extension. See the
                <a href="https://course-profiles.uq.edu.au/student_section_loader/section_1/98098">course
                    profile</a> for details of how to apply for an extension. Requests for extensions must be made
                <strong>no later</strong> than <u>48 hours</u> prior to the submission deadline. The expectation
                is that with less than 48 hours before an assignment is due it should be substantially completed
                and submittable. Applications for extension, and any supporting documentation (e.g. medical
                certificate), must be submitted via <a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/">my.UQ</a>. You must retain
                the original documentation for a <em>minimum period</em> of six months to provide as verification
                should you be requested to do so.
