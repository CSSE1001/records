                <p>The goal of this assignment is to produce a simplistic 2D platformer game with Python.</p>

                <p>This assignment will give you an opportunity to utilise the concepts that you have already
                    learnt this semester. You will be asked to write several functions, outlined in this document,
                    to successfully implement the expected game.
                </p>

                <p>The archive <code>a1_files.zip</code> contains all the necessary files to start this assignment. Some
                    support code has been provided to assist with loading levels of the game. Additionally some map
                    files have been provided (level1.txt, level2.txt, etc).
                </p>

                <p>The main assignment file is <code>a1.py</code>, which contains the base you will use to
                    implement your assignment.</p>

                <p>The other provided file is <code>a1_support.py</code>, which contains some code to help
                    you implement your assignment. You are not required to use this file to implement your assignment
                    but it is strongly recommended.

            <h2 class="header">Concepts</h2><a name="sec_concepts"></a>

            <p>There are a couple of important concepts to help you understand how to complete the assignment.</p>

            <p><strong>levels</strong>: Levels are stored as text files which represent the playing
                field or map of the game. Levels are loaded from the text files using the <code>load_level</code>
                function in the support code. This will return a string representation of the level which
                is used by your program to play the game.
            </p>

            <p><strong>positions</strong>: Positions are represented as tuples which store two integers.
                The first integer in a position tuple is the <strong>x</strong> coordinate, starting at zero from
                the left side of the game window. The second integer in a position tuple is the <strong>y</strong>
                coordinate, starting at zero from the bottom side of the game window.
            </p>

            <p><strong>directions</strong>: Directions are represented by characters, and can only have one of the values "r", "l", "u" or "d" (representing right, left, up, and down respectively). For any function which deals with directions, you are not required to handle any inputs which do not have one of these values.
            </p>

            <p><strong>tiles</strong>: Tiles are characters from a level file. There are 7 different possible tiles.
                <table class="mark-breakdown striped">
                    <thead>
                    <tr>

            <h2 class="header">Implementation</h2><a name="sec_implementation"></a>

            <p>To successfully complete this assignment you will need to implement the following functions exactly as
                they are described.</p>

            <p>
                <strong><code>get_position_in_direction(position, direction)</code></strong><br/>
                <span>
                    Return the position that would result from moving from given position in the given direction.<br/>
                    If the direction "r" is given, increase the x coordinate by 1.<br/>
                    If the direction "l" is given, decrease the x coordinate by 1.<br/>
                    If the direction "u" is given, increase the y coordinate by 1.<br/>
                    If the direction "d" is given, decrease the y coordinate by 1.
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong><code>get_tile_at_position(level, position)</code></strong><br/>
                <span>
                    Return the character representing the tile at the given position in a level string.
                    Hint: refer to <code>position_to_index</code> in the support file.
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong><code>get_tile_in_direction(level, position, direction)</code></strong><br/>
                <span>
                    Determine the new position which results from moving the given position in the given direction, and return the character representing the tile found at this new position.
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong><code>remove_from_level(level, position)</code></strong><br/>
                <span>
                    Return a level string exactly the same as the one given, but with the given position replaced by an air tile.
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong><code>move(level, position, direction)</code></strong><br/>
                <span>
                    Return the updated position that results from moving the character from the given position in the given direction.<br/>

                    If the tile at the updated position is a wall tile, adjust the position up until an air tile is found and return
                    that as the position instead.<br/>

                    If the tile immediately below the next position is an air tile, adjust the position down until the tile below
                    is a not an air tile and return that as the position instead.<br/>

                    It is important that you check whether the next position is a wall tile before checking if the tile below is
                    an air tile.
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong><code>print_level(level, position)</code></strong><br/>
                <span>
                    Print the level (i.e. string) with the tile of the given position replaced by the player tile.
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong><code>attack(level, position)</code></strong><br/>
                <span>
                    Check if the position to the left of the player is a monster, if it is then print
                    <code>Attacking the monster on your left!</code> and return the level with the monster tile removed.<br/>

                    Check if the position to the right of the player is a monster, if it is then print
                    <code>Attacking the monster on your right!</code> and return the level with the monster tile removed.<br/>

                    If neither the left side nor the right side of the player contains a monster, then print
                    <code>No monsters to attack!</code> and return the level unchanged.
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong><code>tile_status(level, position)</code></strong><br/>
                <span>
                    If the tile at the position is the goal tile then print
                    <code>Congratulations! You finished the level</code><br/>

                    If the tile at the position is a monster tile then print
                    <code>Hit a monster!</code><br/>

                    If the tile at the position is either a coin tile or checkpoint tile, remove the tile from the
                    level.<br/>

                    Finally, return a tuple containing the tile character and the level.
                </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong><code>main</code></strong><br/>
                <p>Handles the main interaction with the user.</p>

                <p>
                    When the game starts, it should ask the user for a file to load a level from as follows: <code>Please enter the name of the level file (e.g. level1.txt): </code>
                </p>

                <p>Once the user enters the name of the level file, it should load that level from the file and print
                    the current score as <code>Score: 0</code> followed by printing the loaded level with the player
                    at the starting position of x=0, y=1.
                </p>

                <p>The program should then repeatedly ask the user <code>Please enter an action (enter '?' for help): </code>
                </p>

                <p>After each action is input, it should perform the action and print out the current score and the level.
                    Actions are described in the table below.
                </p>

        <section>
            <h3>Bonus &ndash; Checkpoints</h3><a name="sec_bonus"></a>

            <p>This task involves adding checkpoints to the game. A checkpoint is a tile in the game which
                triggers the saving of the current state (level map, player position and player score) when the player moves
                to that tile.
            </p>

            <p>If the player is killed by an enemy then the level should be reset to the last state saved
                by a checkpoint.
            </p>

            <p>Checkpoints should be implemented as apart of your <code>main</code> function.</p>

            <p>The marks associated with this task are additional marks that will increase the total to
                above 10 marks. You will still be limited to a total of 10 marks for this assignment.
                The intention of this task is to allow you to demonstrate a good understanding of the content
                that will allow for some marks to be lost in other areas while still receiving full marks.

            <p>The marks in this section add to a total of 20, which will
                be scaled down to the 10 marks available for this assignment.
                Marks will be awared based on the formula below:
            </p>

            <pre style="align-content: center">
Total Mark = min( (functionality + bonus + style)/2, 10 )

                <p>Your assignment will be marked automatically using the test suite provided.
                    Marks will be awarded based on how many tests pass.
                </p>

                <p>Syntax errors which prevent your assignment from running will be removed
                    from your assignment where reasonable, deducting one mark per syntax error for up to 3 syntax errors.
                    What is considered a reasonable fix to your assignment is left to the
                    judgement of the tutor who marks your assignment and their judgement is final.

            <p>Your assignment must be submitted via the assignment one submission link on Blackboard.
                You must submit a Python file, <code>a1.py</code>, containing your implementation of the assignment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Late submission of the assignment will <strong>not</strong> be accepted. Do not wait until the last
                minute to submit your assignment, as the time to upload it may make it late. Multiple submissions are
                allowed, so ensure that you have submitted an almost complete version of the assignment <em>well</em>
                before the submission deadline. Your latest on-time, submission will be marked. Ensure that you submit
                the correct version of your assignment. An incorrect version that does not work <strong>will</strong>
                be marked as your final submission.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the event of exceptional circumstances, you may submit a request for an extension. See the
                <a href="https://www.courses.uq.edu.au/student_section_loader.php?section=5&profileId=98649">course
                    profile</a> for details of how to apply for an extension. Requests for extensions must be made
                <strong>no later</strong> than <u>48 hours</u> prior to the submission deadline. The expectation
                is that with less than 48 hours before an assignment is due it should be substantially completed
                and submittable. Applications for extension, and any supporting documentation (e.g. medical
                certificate), must be submitted via <a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/">my.UQ</a>. You must retain
                the original documentation for a <em>minimum period</em> of six months to provide as verification
                should you be requested to do so.
