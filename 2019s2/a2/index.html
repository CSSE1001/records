                <p>
                    This assignment follows a programming pattern called MVC
                    <!-- or at least tries to -->
                    (the Model, View, Controller) pattern. You have been provided
                    with the view and controller classes but you will be required
                    to implement several modelling classes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The modelling classes are based on the children's card game,
                    Sleeping Queens. Each class you're required to implement has
                    a specification that is outlined in this document.
                    A specification is a description of each method in a class
                    as well as their parameters and return values.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once you have correctly implemented the modelling classes,
                    you will have completed a digital version of Sleeping Coders.

            <p>
                Sleeping Coders (Coders for short) is a card game that is
                based on the popular children's card game, Sleeping Queens.
                The aim of the game is to wake as many sleeping coders as possible.
                A sleeping coder is woken by playing a tutor card.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the start of the game there are 16 coders placed face down
                in the center of the board, a face down coder card means that
                coder is sleeping. Each player is dealt five cards
                randomly. Players will take turns playing a card from their
                deck; number cards have no action and are meant to be disposed
                of while other cards have actions attributed to their playing.
            </p>

            <p>
                A tutor card can be played at any time. When a tutor card is played
                the player who played it can pick up one of the coder cards from
                the center of the board.
            </p>

            <p>
                Playing a keyboard kidnapper card will allow the player to take
                a coder card from another player.
            </p>

            <p>
                Playing an all-nighter card will allow the player to put another player's
                coder back to sleep (add it back to the center of the board).
            </p>

            <p>
                The aim of the game is to collect coders by waking them up.
                The first player to collect 4 coders wins the game.

            A card represents a card in the game, which may be a coder card or
            a playable card held by the players in the game.

                    The base card with methods for playing a card and performing a card action.

                    Should also set the action that needs to be performed (see <code>CodersGame.set_action</code>).

                    For tutor cards, this action is selecting a coder from the pile. For keyboard kidnapper and all-nighter cards,
                    this is selecting a coder from another player's hand.

            <p>A player represents one of the players in the game.</p>

            <p>The Player class should be initiated with Player(name) and implement the following methods:</p>

            <p><strong>get_name(self) -> str:</strong> Returns the name of the player.</p>
            <p><strong>get_hand(self) -> Deck:</strong> Returns the players deck of cards.</p>
            <p><strong>get_coders(self) -> Deck:</strong> Returns the players deck of collected coder cards.</p>
            <p><strong>has_won(self) -> bool:</strong> Returns True if and only if the player has 4 or more coders.</p>
            
            <p><span data-version="1.0.2"><strong>__str__(self) -> str:</strong> Returns the string representation of the player, for a player with name of 'Luis', hand deck of 'hand' and coder deck of 'coders', this should be 'Player(Luis, hand, coders)'. See the examples for more details.</span></p>
            <p><span data-version="1.0.2"><strong>__repr__(self) -> str:</strong> Same as __str__(self).</span></p>

            <p>The marks in this section add to a total of 30, which will
                be scaled down to the 15 marks available for this assignment.
                Marks will be awarded based on the formula below:
            </p>

            <pre style="align-content: center">
Total Mark = (functionality + style)/2

            <section><h3>Functionality Assessment</h3><a name="sec_functionality"></a>

                <p>Your assignment will be marked automatically using the test suite provided.
                    Marks will be awarded based on how many tests pass.
                </p>

                <p>Syntax errors which prevent your assignment from running will be removed
                    from your assignment where reasonable, deducting one mark per syntax error for up to 3 syntax errors.
                    What is considered a reasonable fix to your assignment is left to the
                    judgement of the tutor who marks your assignment and their judgement is final.

            <h2 class="header">Assignment Submission</h2><a
                name="sec_submission"></a>
            <p>Your assignment must be submitted via the assignment one submission link on Blackboard.
                You must submit a Python file, <code>a2.py</code>, containing your implementation of the assignment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Late submission of the assignment will <strong>not</strong> be accepted. Do not wait until the last
                minute to submit your assignment, as the time to upload it may make it late. Multiple submissions are
                allowed, so ensure that you have submitted an almost complete version of the assignment <em>well</em>
                before the submission deadline. Your latest on-time, submission will be marked. Ensure that you submit
                the correct version of your assignment. An incorrect version that does not work <strong>will</strong>
                be marked as your final submission.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the event of exceptional circumstances, you may submit a request for an extension. See the

                <strong>no later</strong> than <u>48 hours</u> prior to the submission deadline. The expectation
                is that with less than 48 hours before an assignment is due it should be substantially completed
                and submittable. Applications for extension, and any supporting documentation (e.g. medical
                certificate), must be submitted via <a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/">my.UQ</a>. You must retain
                the original documentation for a <em>minimum period</em> of six months to provide as verification
                should you be requested to do so.
