                <p>This assignment provides you the opportunity to apply concepts taught throughout the course to extend
                    the functionality of a basic dot game, which has been modelled on <a
                            href="https://www.dots.co/dotsandco/">Dots &amp; Co</a>.

                <p>
                    The assignment will focus on the concept of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). You will be required
                    to extend the base game with basic, intermediate, and advanced features. Postgraduate students will
                    have an additional task.
                </p>

                <p>Students are encouraged to review <a href="https://www.dots.co/dotsandco/">Dots &amp; Co</a>, as well
                    as other similar games, to better understand how the game is played and for inspiration on advanced
                    features.</p>

                <p>Because this assignment deals with multiple files, students are encouraged to investigate a more
                    capable IDE. The author recommends <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>, which
                    is <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/student/">free for students</a>.</p>

                    <p>Dots &amp; Co is a simple game where the player tries to create connections between dots on a
                        grid in order to reach objectives.</p>

                    <p>The player can click on a dot and drag to an adjacent dot (up/down/left/right only) to select a
                        dot to form a connection, continuing on to another adjacent dot to select it to form another
                        connection, et cetera. When the player stops dragging and releases, all dots in that have been
                        selected will be activated and removed. <span data-version="1.1.0">The most basic dots do not have any effect when activated.</span>
                        Replacements drop down from the cells above, and new dots are generated off-screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the player drags back to their second-most-recently selected dot, the most-recently selected
                        dot is deselected.
                    </p>

                    <p><span data-version="1.1.0">When the user finishes their selection, if the selection contains a loop,
                        all dots of the selected kind will also be included in the activation.</span></p>

                <p>
                    Before beginning work on the assignment you must download <a
                        href="https://csse1001.uqcloud.net/assignments/assignment3/a3_files.zip"><code>a3_files.zip</code></a>
                    provided from the course website.

                    Inside <a href="https://csse1001.uqcloud.net/assignments/assignment3/a3_files.zip"><code>a3_files.zip</code></a>,
                    there should be a file called <code>a3.py</code>. This is the file where you will write your
                    assignment. The other files are support files. These <strong>must not</strong> be edited. Their
                    purpose is explained below.
                </p>
            </section>

            <p>Some tasks require you to submit brief descriptions of features implemented (<a
                    href="#sec_task2"></a>, <a href="#sec_task3"></a>, <a href="#sec_postgrad"></a>). These descriptions
                <strong>must</strong> be submitted in a single PDF document called <code>description.pdf</code>
                &mdash; other formats such as Microsoft Word or misnamed files may not be accepted.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="header">Support Code</h2><a name="sec_support"></a>

            <p>The file <code>a3.py</code> is the main assignment file. This file includes a few hundred lines of code
                that leverages the support code to help you get started. You must modify &amp; add to this file in order
                to complete the assignment tasks.</p>
            <p><em>You are also permitted to create other files to simplify the separation of tasks (i.e.
                <code>task1.py</code>, <code>task2.py</code>, etc.). If you do this, <code>a3.py</code> must be the
                entry point to your application. One way to achieve this is to move <code>DotsApp</code> to a separate
                file, such as <code>base.py</code>. <strong>Regardless of how you structure your files, the code must
                    all be able to be demonstrated by running <code>a3.py</code></strong></em>.</p>

            <p>You have been supplied with a copious amount of support code to help you complete this assignment. To
                begin the assignment, you do not need to understand much of this code. As you progress through the
                tasks, the degree to which you should understand this code will increase.</p>

            <blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>In this section, the word function is used to mean anything that is able
                to be called like a function, such as a method, a lambda, etc. The generic technical term for this is
                <code>callable</code>.
            </blockquote>
            <p>

                The <code>DotGame</code> &amp; <code>GridView</code> classes follow a pattern which allows a function to
                be attached to an event. When the event is triggered/emitted, the function is called. This function is
                called a listener or a callback, and this attaching action can also be referred to as binding to or
                listening for an event. Code that triggers an event can also supply arguments to the event functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This pattern is called the Event Emitter pattern, and is an implementation of the Observer pattern (the
                Publisher/Subscriber pattern is similar). It is also an example of a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function#Python_2">higher&ndash;order function</a>
                (the function does the binding accepts the listener function as an argument).
            </p>
            <p>
                While it is also quite a similar approach to how Tkinter handles commands for button presses, the Event
                Emitter pattern is far more flexible in general, primarily because multiple listeners can be attached to
                the same event.

            </p>
            <p>
                The events emitted by the <code>DotGame</code> &amp; <code>GridView</code> classes are very useful,
                particularly for creating non-blocking animation. The supplied code binds to every relevant event
                emitted by these classes. See <code>DotsApp.bind_events</code> in the <code>a3.py</code> file.

                The purpose of this task is to create the basic graphical user interface (GUI) for the Dots game. There

                creating the user interface demonstrated below.

                <p>You have been supplied with an incomplete implementation of <code>DotsApp</code> to start with. You
                    should modify this class to implement the required functionality.</p>

                <p>The very first part of this task is to get the app onto the screen. Add your GUI instantiation code
                    to the <code>main</code> function in <code>a3.py</code></p>

                <p>Next, review the <code>DotsApp</code> class and modify the code as required to implement the basic
                    GUI.</p>

                <p>The title of the window should be set to something appropriate (i.e. <code>Dots</code>). This also
                    applies to any window in subsequent tasks.</p>
                <p>

                    As the basic GUI is improved in subsequent tasks, <strong>the <code>DotsApp</code> class will need
                    to be modified accordingly</strong>. It is also permitted, to create separate classes for each task
                    using inheritance &mdash; this is not required.

            <p>
                The purpose of this task is to extend the functionality of the basic GUI by adding additional dots and
                companion functionality.
            </p>

            <p>
                Companions are helpful side characters that can be activated to perform a special ability. Every time a
                companion dot is activated, the companion is charged (by one). When a companion is fully charged, their
                ability is activated. Once activated, a companion's charge is reset to zero, ready to be charged again.
                By default, a companion is fully charged when it has been charged six times.
            </p>

                used, and instructions on how to install them. For example if you have used Pillow module, then the
                following would be sufficient:
            </p>

            <blockquote>Version 4.2.1 of Pillow has been used. Install the Pillow module with pip using the command:<br>

            <h2>Dot &amp; Companion Options</h2><a name="sec_dot_and_companion_options"></a>

            <p>If any any dots or companions are implemented, the submission must include a brief description of what
                has been implemented. This must be included in <code>description.pdf</code> &mdash; see <a
                        href="#sec_submission"></a></p>

            <p data-version="1.1.0">Students may use the supplied images for dots/companions, but may also use images of
                their own choosing.</p>

            <p>Students are also permitted to implement dots/companions of their own choosing, but should discuss this
                with course staff prior to doing so.</p>

            <p>Any dots implemented <strong>must inherit</strong> from <code>AbstractDot</code> (or one of its
                subclasses) in the <code data-version="1.1.0">dot.py</code> file. Similarly, any companions implemented
                <strong>must inherit</strong> from <code>AbstractCompanion</code> (or one of its subclasses) in the
                <code data-version="1.1.0">companion.py</code> file. <strong>This is very important</strong>, as these
                <code>Abstract</code> classes define a common interface with all dots/companions (i.e. one can expect
                that any method defined on <code>AbstractDot</code> will also be available on any type of Dot class).
